# Client-side-crud-operation
Developed a simple client-side CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to manage data directly in the browser without a backend. This project demonstrates my understanding of core web development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic data rendering.
